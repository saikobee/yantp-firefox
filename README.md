# Yet Another New Tab Page
## For Firefox

This is essentially the Chrome yantp extension made for Firefox. It'll probably
end up a little different, though.

## Dependencies

Install [`cfx`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation).

## Running

`cfx run`

## Installation

- `cfx xpi`
- Drag XPI file onto Firefox

## Thanks

This is my first Firefox extension, and I couldn't have done it alone. Thanks
to everyone who has worked on [the MDN add-on sdk documentation], and everyone
who helped out in the Mozilla IRC `#jetpack` channel.

Thanks especially to `zombie_` and `KWierso` for helping me figure out how to
open the Firefox library organizer.
